- `there be`句子主语用`there`.
- 当主语是一个句子时, 用`it`代
- 祈使句使用 `will you?/shall we`?

例1:

- He can speack English, **can't he?**

### 选择疑问句

回答从问题里面二选一.

### 特殊疑问句

> 具体提问, 具体回答

**代词词性**

名词: `what,which,who,whom`

形容词: `what,which,whose`

副词: `when,where,why,how`

#### What

- what做宾语: you want a cat. --> What do you want?

> 疑问句相当于部分倒装, 谓语要提前 , want要用do代表

- what做表语: Your problem is your face. --> what is your problem?
- what做定语: You want size 5. --> What size do you want?
- what做主语: All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy? --> What makes Jack a dull boy?

#### Which

> what与which的主要区别就是, 前者没有确定范围, 后者在确定范围里具体选择

- which做宾语: You want the red one. --> Which do you want?
- 做表语: My choice is the red one. --> Which is your choice?
- 做定语: You are in class 5. --> Which class are you in?
- 做主语: The red one is better. --> Which is better?

#### Who

- 主语: Jay is my favorite singer. -->Who is your favorite singer?
- 主语: Jay makes the best music. --> Who makes the best music?

#### whom(谁)

> whom只能做宾语.
>
> who与whom的区别就是who做主语, whom做宾语. 在日常口语中不常见, 只在书面中存在

- I choose Jay. --> whom do your choose?

#### whose(谁的,adj)

- I will join Jay's team. --> Whose team will your join ? 

> 有助动词提前助动词

- Jay's music is the best. --> whose music is the best?

#### When(几时),Where(何处),Why(为何),How(怎样) [adv]

- I came here at 8:30. --> when did you came here?
- I came here by bus. --> How did you came here?

### 总结

- 疑问词不作主语--特殊疑问词+一般疑问句语序
- 作主语--不变序
- 有助动词提前助动词, 有be动词提前be动词, 其他情况抽象成狭义助动词
